## Requirements
The requirements to run this connector, such as, an App Registration, to be run on-premises, run with concurrent sessions set to a max. of 1, etc.
An example is given below:

- Make sure you have Windows PowerShell 5.1 installed on the server where the HelloID agent and Service Automation agent are running.
- **App ID & App Secret** for the app registration with permissions to the Microsoft Graph API.
- Make sure the sychronization is configured to meet your requirements.
- Setup synchronization of Entra ID or local AD users and groups to HelloID.
  - This can be either the [local AD sync](https://docs.helloid.com/en/access-management/directory-sync/active-directory-sync.html) or the [Entra ID sync](https://docs.helloid.com/en/access-management/directory-sync/azure-ad-sync.html).
  > If using the [local AD sync](https://docs.helloid.com/en/access-management/directory-sync/active-directory-sync.html), make sure the userAttribute "userPrincipalName" is mapped and synced. Also make sure to change the **$taskVariableUserValue** accordingly.

## Introduction
By using this connector, you will have the ability to create and remove HelloID SelfService Products based on groups in your Entra ID.

The products will be create for each group in scope. This way you won't have to manually create a product for each group.

And vice versa for the removing of the products. The products will be removed (or disabled, based on your preference) when a group is nog longer in scope. This way no products will remain that "should no longer exist".

This is intended for scenarios where there are (lots of) groups that we want to be requestable as a product. This group sync is desinged to work in combination with the [Entra ID Groupmembersips to Productassignments Sync](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-SA-Sync-AzureActiveDirectory-Groupmemberships-To-SelfService-Productassignments).

## Getting started

### Create an API key and secret for HelloID
1. Go to the `Manage portal > Security > API` section.
2. Click on the `Add Api key` button to create a new API key.
3. Optionally, you can add a note that will describe the purpose of this API key
4. Optionally, you can restrict the IP addresses from which this API key can be used.
5. Click on the `Save` button to save the API key.
6. Go to the `Manage portal > Automation > Variable library` section and confim that the auto variables specified in the [connection settings](#connection-settings) are available.

### Getting the Entra ID graph API access

By using this connector you will have the ability to manage Entra ID Guest accounts.

#### Application Registration
The first step to connect to Graph API and make requests, is to register a new <b>Entra ID Application</b>. The application is used to connect to the API and to manage permissions.

* Navigate to <b>App Registrations</b> in Entra ID, and select “New Registration” (<b>Entra Portal > Entra ID > App Registration > New Application Registration</b>).
* Next, give the application a name. In this example we are using “<b>HelloID PowerShell</b>” as application name.
* Specify who can use this application (<b>Accounts in this organizational directory only</b>).
* Specify the Redirect URI. You can enter any url as a redirect URI value. In this example we used http://localhost because it doesn't have to resolve.
* Click the “<b>Register</b>” button to finally create your new application.

Some key items regarding the application are the Application ID (which is the Client ID), the Directory ID (which is the Tenant ID) and Client Secret.

#### Configuring App Permissions
The [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) provides details on which permission are required for each permission type.

To assign your application the right permissions, navigate to <b>Entra Portal > Entra ID >App Registrations</b>.
Select the application we created before, and select “<b>API Permissions</b>” or “<b>View API Permissions</b>”.
To assign a new permission to your application, click the “<b>Add a permission</b>” button.
From the “<b>Request API Permissions</b>” screen click “<b>Microsoft Graph</b>”.
For this connector the following permissions are used as <b>Application permissions</b>:
*	Read and Write all user’s full profiles by using <b><i>User.ReadWrite.All</i></b>
*	Read and Write all groups in an organization’s directory by using <b><i>Group.ReadWrite.All</i></b>
*	Read and Write data to an organization’s directory by using <b><i>Directory.ReadWrite.All</i></b>

Some high-privilege permissions can be set to admin-restricted and require an administrators consent to be granted.

To grant admin consent to our application press the “<b>Grant admin consent for TENANT</b>” button.

#### Authentication and Authorization
There are multiple ways to authenticate to the Graph API with each has its own pros and cons, in this example we are using the Authorization Code grant type.

*	First we need to get the <b>Client ID</b>, go to the <b>Entra Portal > Entra ID > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select your application and copy the Application (client) ID value.
*	After we have the Client ID we also have to create a <b>Client Secret</b>.
*	From the Entra Portal, go to <b>Entra ID > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select the application we have created before, and select "<b>Certificates and Secrets</b>". 
*	Under “Client Secrets” click on the “<b>New Client Secret</b>” button to create a new secret.
*	Provide a logical name for your secret in the Description field, and select the expiration date for your secret.
*	It's IMPORTANT to copy the newly generated client secret, because you cannot see the value anymore after you close the page.
*	At last we need to get the <b>Tenant ID</b>. This can be found in the Entra Portal by going to <b>Entra ID > Overview</b>.

## Remarks
- The Products are created and removed by default. Make sure your configuration is correct to avoid unwanted removals (and change this to disable)
- This group sync is desinged to work in combination with the [Entra ID Groupmembersips to Productassignments Sync](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-SA-Sync-AzureActiveDirectory-Groupmemberships-To-SelfService-Productassignments).
